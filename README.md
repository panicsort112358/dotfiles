# .dotfiles

Personal configuration files, organized as GNU Stow packages.

On macOS, run `brew bundle` to install GNU Stow and LLVM. Then run `./install.sh` to link the Vim and zsh configs into your home directory. The zsh package manages interactive settings in `.zshrc`; login-shell settings stay in the machine-local `.zprofile`.

Homebrew's LLVM is keg-only. To use its `clang++` and `clang-format` commands from the shell, add `export PATH="$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:$PATH"` to the machine-local `.zprofile`.

## C++ project settings

Copy the templates into a C++ project:

```sh
cp templates/cpp/.clang-format /path/to/project/
```

The formatting template uses four-space indentation and a 100-column limit. For a standalone-file project without a compilation database, also copy `templates/cpp/.clangd` there and adjust its C++ standard if needed. For projects with a build system, prefer its `compile_commands.json` so clangd sees the actual compiler flags.
